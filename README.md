# Description

This sample app demonstrates how to record a message from an inbound call, similar to how a voicemail machine would work.

When the user calls the Bandwidth phone number associated with this application, the user will hear an audio prompt to leave a message, then a beep. Once this happens, the call will begin recording, for up to 30 seconds.

When the call ends, Bandwidth will start to process the recording. Once this processing is complete, Bandwidth will send a webhook to the `/callbacks/inbound/voice/recordingAvailable` endpoint on this application. Once received, the application will download the recording via Bandwidth's voice recording API.

# Pre-Requisites

In order to use the Bandwidth API users need to set up the appropriate application at the [Bandwidth Dashboard](https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/) and create API tokens.

To create an application log into the [Bandwidth Dashboard](https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/) and navigate to the `Applications` tab.  Fill out the **New Application** form selecting the service (Messaging or Voice) that the application will be used for.  All Bandwidth services require publicly accessible Callback URLs, for more information on how to set one up see [Callback URLs](#callback-urls).

For more information about API credentials see our [Account Credentials](https://dev.bandwidth.com/docs/account/credentials) page.

# Running the Application

To install the required packages for this app, run the command:

```sh
composer install
```

Use the following command to run the application:

```sh
composer start
```

# Environmental Variables

The sample app uses the below environmental variables.

```sh
BW_ACCOUNT_ID                        # Your Bandwidth Account Id
BW_CLIENT_ID                         # Your Bandwidth API OAuth Client Id
BW_CLIENT_SECRET                     # Your Bandwidth API OAuth Client Secret
LOCAL_PORT                           # The port number you wish to run the sample on
```

# Callback URLs

For a detailed introduction, check out our [Bandwidth Voice Callbacks](https://dev.bandwidth.com/docs/voice/webhooks) page.

Below are the callback paths:
* `/callbacks/inbound/voice`
* `/callbacks/inbound/voice/recordingAvailable`

The app also serves the prompt tone at `/tone.mp3`, which is not a callback.

## Ngrok

A simple way to set up a local callback URL for testing is to use the free tool [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).  
After you have downloaded and installed `ngrok` run the following command to open a public tunnel to your port (`$LOCAL_PORT`)

```sh
ngrok http $LOCAL_PORT
```

You can view your public URL at `http://127.0.0.1:4040` after ngrok is running.  You can also view the status of the tunnel and requests/responses here. Once your public ngrok url has been created, you can set it, followed by `/callbacks/inbound/voice`, as the callback URL of the voice application created in the [Pre-Requisites](#pre-requisites) section.
